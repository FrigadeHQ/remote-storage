## Why
Storing data in localStorage is great, but it's not a good solution for storing data that needs to be shared across multiple devices for the same user. For example, if you want to store whether a user has seen the announcement of a new feature, you can't do that with localStorage because it's only available on the device that the user is currently using.

You could  spin up a database, but that's a lot of work for storing simple impression events, and it's not very scalable to always involve backend engineering to store the state of a simple binary flag.

That's where centralStorage comes in. It's a simple, open source library and server that allows you to store data in a centralized storage.

## Features

- üîß Simple API (same as localStorage)
- üöÄ Works with all Javascript frameworks
- üì¶ Lightweight (~2 kB)
- ‚ú® Open source and self-hostable
- üç¶ Free hosted community server


## Quick start

Install the library:

```bash
npm install central-storage
```

Import the library and use it like you would localStorage:

```javascript
import { CentralStorage } from 'central-storage'


const centralStorage = new CentralStorage('https://central-storage.frigade.com')


const hasSeenModals = await centralStorage.getItem('hasSeenModals')

if (!hasSeenModals) {
  await centralStorage.setItem('hasSeenModals', true)
}
```
