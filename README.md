## Why
Storing data in localStorage is useful, but it's not a good solution when you store data that needs to be shared across multiple devices or browsers.

For instance, let's say you want to show a welcome modal to all new users that sign up for your product. If you use localStorage to track if a user has already seen this modal, your users will continue to get the experience over and over again every time they switch devices or browsers.

That's where remoteStorage comes in. Using the same API as localStorage, remoteStorage allows you to easily read and write data on the fly while maintaining state across browsers and devices in order to provide a better user experience.

## Features

- üîß Simple API (same as localStorage)
- üöÄ Works with all Javascript frameworks
- üì¶ Lightweight (~2 kB)
- ‚ú® Open source server and client (MIT license)
- üç¶ Free hosted community server


## Quick start

Install the library:

```bash
npm install remote-storage
```

Import the library and use it like you would localStorage:

```javascript
import { RemoteStorage } from 'remote-storage'

const remoteStorage = new RemoteStorage({ serverUrl: 'https://server.centralstorage.dev' })

const hasSeenNewFeature = await remoteStorage.getItem('hasSeenNewFeature')

if (!hasSeenNewFeature) {
  await remoteStorage.setItem('hasSeenNewFeature', true)
}
```

That's it!

## Documentation

### User IDs

remoteStorage uses user IDs to identify users. A user ID is a string that uniquely identifies a user. It can be anything you want, but we recommend using a UUID.

The User ID is set when you create a new instance of remoteStorage:

```javascript
const remoteStorage = new RemoteStorage({
  serverUrl: 'https://server.centralstorage.dev',
  userId: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
})
```

### Instance IDs

remoteStorage uses instance IDs to identify the application instance that is making the request. An instance ID is a string that uniquely identifies an application instance. Typically you would use the same instance ID for all requests from the same application instance.

The instance ID is set when you create a new instance of remoteStorage:

```javascript
const remoteStorage = new RemoteStorage({
  serverUrl: 'https://server.centralstorage.dev',
  userId: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
  instanceId: 'my-cool-app'
})
```

### Server

We offer a free hosted community server at `https://server.centraldstorage.dev`. The server should not be used for production apps, but it's great for testing and prototyping.

The server can be spun up using Docker in a few minutes. To get started, simply clone the repository and run `docker-compose up`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FrigadeHQ/remote-storage.git
cd remote-storage/apps/server
docker-compose up
```

The server runs on port 4000 by default.
