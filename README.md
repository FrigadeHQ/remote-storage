## Why
Storing data in localStorage is great, but it's not a good solution for storing data that needs to be shared across multiple devices for the same user. For example, if you want to store whether a user has seen the announcement of a new feature, you can't do that with localStorage because it's only available on the device that the user is currently using.

You could  spin up a database, but that's a lot of work for storing simple impression events, and it's not very scalable to always involve backend engineering to store the state of a simple binary flag.

That's where centralStorage comes in. It's a simple, open source library and server that allows you to store data in a centralized storage.

## Features

- üîß Simple API (same as localStorage)
- üöÄ Works with all Javascript frameworks
- üì¶ Lightweight (~2 kB)
- ‚ú® Open source and self-hostable
- üç¶ Free hosted community server


## Quick start

Install the library:

```bash
npm install central-storage
```

Import the library and use it like you would localStorage:

```javascript
import { CentralStorage } from 'central-storage'


const centralStorage = new CentralStorage({ serverUrl: 'https://server.centralstorage.dev' })


const hasSeenNewFeature = await centralStorage.getItem('hasSeenNewFeature')

if (!hasSeenNewFeature) {
  await centralStorage.setItem('hasSeenNewFeature', true)
}
```

That's it!

## Documentation

### User IDs

centralStorage uses user IDs to identify users. A user ID is a string that uniquely identifies a user. It can be anything you want, but we recommend using a UUID.

The User ID is set when you create a new instance of centralStorage:

```javascript
const centralStorage = new CentralStorage({
  serverUrl: 'https://server.centralstorage.dev',
  userId: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'
})
```

### Instance IDs

centralStorage uses instance IDs to identify the application instance that is making the request. An instance ID is a string that uniquely identifies an application instance. Typically you would use the same instance ID for all requests from the same application instance.

The instance ID is set when you create a new instance of centralStorage:

```javascript
const centralStorage = new CentralStorage({
  serverUrl: 'https://server.centralstorage.dev',
  userId: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
  instanceId: 'my-cool-app'
})
```

### Server

We offer a free hosted community server at `https://server.centraldstorage.dev`. The server should not be used for production apps, but it's great for testing and prototyping.

The server can be spun up using Docker in a few minutes. To get started, simply clone the repository and run `docker-compose up`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FrigadeHQ/central-storage.git
cd central-storage/apps/server
docker-compose up
```

The server runs on port 4000 by default.
